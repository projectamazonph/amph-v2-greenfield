# Architecture Decision Records — Project Amazon PH Academy v2

**Status:** Active
**Owner:** Ryan Roland Dabao
**Date:** 2026-07-17 (greenfield rebuild)

This document collects the ADRs that govern Project Amazon PH Academy's architecture. New ADRs append below. Each follows the [Michael Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

---

## ADR-001: Modular Monolith over Microservices

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-01)
**Context:** Solo developer, early-stage product, unknown scale.
**Decision:** Build as a single Next.js application. All features in one codebase, one deploy.
**Consequences:**
- Easier to develop alone (no service orchestration)
- Cheaper to run (one Vercel deployment, one Postgres)
- Code-level module boundaries enforced by directory structure
- Migration to microservices later is possible but expensive — defer until revenue justifies
- **Revisit when:** Monthly active users > 10,000 OR team > 3 developers.

## ADR-002: PostgreSQL for All Environments

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-01)
**Context:** Project Amazon PH Academy starts solo with low traffic. Postgres adds hosting cost and operational complexity.
**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL everywhere (dev + production). Consistent environment eliminates provider-specific bugs. CI uses PostgreSQL service container, local dev uses local or remote PostgreSQL.
**Consequences:**
- Schema uses no SQLite-specific features
- Use `prisma migrate dev` for local PostgreSQL, `prisma migrate deploy` for production
- Local seed data is disposable — production data is the source of truth
- **Revisit when:** Monthly active users > 1,000 OR concurrent writes > 10/sec.

## ADR-003: Zero External AI Features

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07)
**Context:** Product rule: no external AI APIs. Platform must work without AI dependencies.
**Decision:** No `openai`, `anthropic`, `langchain`, or any LLM API in the codebase. All content is human-authored. All scoring is deterministic rule-based code.
**Consequences:**
- Simulator scoring is reproducible, testable, and fast.
- No per-call cost surprises.
- No dependency on third-party uptime.
- ESLint rule `local/no-ai-slop` enforces copy that doesn't read like AI marketing.
- See `docs/ai-removal.md` for what AI used to do and what replaced it.

## ADR-008: PHP-Only, No Multi-Currency

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07)
**Context:** Audience is Filipino. Prices are quoted in Philippine peso. PayMongo is the payment provider.
**Decision:** All prices in PHP. No currency conversion. `Money.currency` is a string-typed enum (`"PHP"`) for forward compatibility, but the only supported value today is PHP.
**Consequences:**
- `Money` value object carries an integer `minor` field (centavos), not a float.
- PayMongo's `amount` field maps 1:1 to `Money.minor / 100`.
- No FX risk, no fee on conversion, no exchange-rate drift.
- **Revisit when:** International expansion is real (not hypothetical).

## ADR-009: One-Time Payment, No Subscriptions

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07)
**Context:** Audience mental model is "pay once, learn forever." Subscriptions would create churn anxiety and refund disputes.
**Decision:** One-time payment per tier. Lifetime access. No recurring billing.
**Consequences:**
- PayMongo Checkout (one-time) is the only path. No `recurring` type, no `subscription` table.
- All-access pass exists for the multi-course buyer; still one-time.
- **Revisit when:** Retention data shows <30% of buyers return after 90 days.

## ADR-010: Mobile-First Web, No Native App

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07)
**Context:** Audience is on phones between gigs. Native apps add build, release, and store-listing overhead.
**Decision:** Web only. Mobile-first responsive. No React Native, no Flutter, no PWA install prompt in v2.
**Consequences:**
- Lighthouse CI enforces mobile perf budget.
- All UI must work at 390px width.
- **Revisit when:** MAU > 5,000 AND app-store demand exists.

## ADR-011: Discord for Community

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07)
**Context:** Building community features in-app is a separate product surface, not a learning feature.
**Decision:** Use Discord for community. Link to it from the dashboard. No in-app forum, no comments, no DMs.
**Consequences:**
- One less product surface to build and moderate.
- Discord already has the moderation tools Discord has.
- **Revisit when:** Discord itself becomes a blocker (e.g. paid tier required for moderation).

## ADR-012: No Instructor-Led Cohorts Beyond Live Classes

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07)
**Context:** Cohort-based courses (with weekly assignments, peer review, etc.) are a different product.
**Decision:** No cohorts. Live classes (Ultimate tier) are the only synchronous component. Everything else is self-paced.
**Consequences:**
- No cohort scheduling, no assignment submission, no peer review.
- **Revisit when:** Ultimate retention is high AND alumni ask for it.

## ADR-013: Five-Layer SOLID Architecture

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** The legacy `amph-v2` (12 sprints shipped) accreted ad-hoc coupling. Adding a second-tier course, a third payment provider, or a fourth simulator required edits across `lib/`, `engine/`, `app/actions/`, the tools page, the access policy, and the API route. Tests were skipped because mocking the real Prisma client and the real PayMongo SDK was painful.
**Decision:** Build the greenfield on five layers, dependency direction always inward:

```
app/         → usecases/ → ports/ ← infra/
              domain/  (imports nothing)
```

- `src/domain/` — entities, value objects, pure business rules. No framework imports.
- `src/ports/` — interfaces. Every method returns `Promise<Result<T, E>>`. Each port has a `Fake*` implementation in `src/infra/<concern>/fake/`.
- `src/usecases/` — one class per use case. Constructor-injected ports. No IO happens here.
- `src/infra/` — adapters. The only layer that imports from `next`, `@prisma/client`, `paymongo`, `resend`, `@sentry/*`.
- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router. RSC by default. Server actions are 5-line shims.
- `src/composition/` — the DI container. The only file that knows concrete types.

**Consequences:**
- Adding a payment provider = new adapter in `src/infra/<provider>/` implementing `PaymentGateway`. No edits to use cases or the app.
- Adding a simulator = one new module in `src/domain/simulators/` + one entry in the registry. No edits to the tools page, access policy, or API.
- Adding an admin feature = one server action + one page; use cases are unchanged.
- Every use case is testable with `buildTestContainer()`, no mocks of real SDKs.
- ESLint boundary rule (ADR-016) blocks the wrong dependency direction at lint time, not at code review.
- Cost: more files, more interfaces. Per-table repositories are 30-line files, not heavyweight abstractions.
- **Revisit when:** Adding a port feels heavier than the alternative would be (5+ ports per table, ports with one impl and no second impl ever planned). Until then, the rule is "ports first, adapters second."

## ADR-014: `Result<T, E>` Across Layer Boundaries

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** The legacy code threw exceptions across layers. Server actions caught and re-threw, error boundaries in RSC caught and rendered fallback UI, but the failure path was hard to test, hard to reason about, and easy to forget.
**Decision:** Every port method returns `Promise<Result<T, E>>`. Use cases return `Promise<Result<T, E>>`. Server actions convert `Result` to a discriminated-union response for the client. Throw only for programmer errors (invariant violations), caught at the boundary.
**Consequences:**
- Failure paths are first-class. Every error case is enumerated in the type.
- Tests are simpler: assert on `Result.ok(...)` vs `Result.err(...)` instead of `expect(() => ...).toThrow()`.
- The boundary between server action and client is explicit: actions return `{ ok: true, value } | { ok: false, error }`.
- `Result.combine(...)` runs parallel validations and short-circuits.
- Cost: typing. Every method signature has both `T` and `E`. The `E` is always a discriminated union.
- **Revisit when:** TypeScript adds standard `Result` / `Either` to the language, or we discover a real cost (e.g. a port where errors are genuinely untyped).

## ADR-015: Single-Tenant, No `orgId`

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-07, carried into greenfield)
**Context:** Project Amazon PH Academy is one organization, not a SaaS for other training businesses.
**Decision:** No `orgId` column. `User` is the only tenant boundary. The three roles (`STUDENT`, `ADMIN`, `SUPER_ADMIN`) are a column on `User`.
**Consequences:**
- Every per-user data access is guarded by `userId = currentUser.id` (or admin role).
- The tenant-isolation audit (`docs/security/tenant-isolation.md`) is simpler — it documents one boundary, not many.
- **Revisit when:** The platform is ever sold as a white-label product (it isn't, and probably won't be).

## ADR-016: ESLint Boundary Rule

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** The five-layer architecture is a convention. Conventions drift. Code review catches drift late.
**Decision:** ESLint blocks the wrong dependency direction mechanically. `src/domain/`, `src/ports/`, and `src/usecases/` cannot import from `next/*`, `@prisma/*`, `paymongo`, `resend`, `@sentry/*`, or `server-only`. `src/app/` cannot import from `@infra/*` or `@prisma/*`.
**Consequences:**
- The boundary is enforced at lint time, on every save (with `pnpm lint --fix --watch` if desired), on every commit (via husky pre-commit), and in CI.
- A real need that the rule blocks is a signal to add a port, not to disable the rule.
- **Revisit when:** The rule blocks three legitimate needs in a row — at that point the rule is misconfigured.

## ADR-017: Composition Root + AsyncLocalStorage Request Container

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** DI requires a container. Globals and singletons are tempting but make tests painful. Next.js has multiple runtimes per request (middleware, RSC, route handlers, server actions).
**Decision:** `src/composition/container.ts` exports `buildContainer()` (real) and `buildTestContainer()` (fakes). `src/composition/requestContainer.ts` wraps it in `AsyncLocalStorage`. Middleware sets up the per-request container. Everything downstream reads via `container.get()`.
**Consequences:**
- No global singletons. The container is per-request.
- Tests can swap individual adapters without rebuilding the whole graph.
- The `AsyncLocalStorage` wrapper means `container.get()` works from server actions, RSC, route handlers — anywhere within a request.
- **Revisit when:** Next.js provides a first-class request-context API that replaces `AsyncLocalStorage` (currently no plan for that).

## ADR-018: `Money` Value Object, Integer Minor Units

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** Money is the most common source of float-related bugs in payment systems. The legacy code mixed `number` and `string` and once lost ₱0.01 in a refund calculation.
**Decision:** A `Money` value object. Constructor takes integer `minor` (centavos) and `currency` (string-typed enum). `Money.php(pesos)` rounds to centavos. Arithmetic (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`) preserves integer. `format()` uses `Intl.NumberFormat`. No method on `Money` returns a `number`.
**Consequences:**
- Floats never cross the payment boundary.
- PayMongo's centavos API maps 1:1 to `Money.minor`.
- All prices in the database are stored as integer `priceMinor` columns, not floats.
- The `Money` class is tested at 100% branch coverage.
- **Revisit when:** We support multiple currencies (not planned; ADR-008).

## ADR-019: Simulator Registry Pattern

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** The legacy `amph-v2` has 5 simulators. Adding a 6th required edits to the tools index page, the access policy, the API route, the engine registry, the scenarios loader, and the type unions. The shape of "what changes" was unpredictable.
**Decision:** A `Simulator<TIn, TOut>` interface in `src/domain/simulators/Simulator.ts`. A `SimulatorRegistry` port that resolves simulators by ID. The tools page reads from the registry, not a hardcoded list. The access policy checks `simulator.requiredTier` from the registry, not a hardcoded mapping.
**Consequences:**
- Adding a 6th simulator is one new file in `src/domain/simulators/<name>/` (the domain logic) + one entry in the registry. The OCP showcase.
- The tools page, access policy, and API route are unchanged for the 6th simulator.
- Tests are uniform: every simulator's `run` is a pure function on a `SimContext`.
- **Revisit when:** A simulator's behavior fundamentally doesn't fit the `Simulator<TIn, TOut>` shape (e.g. needs to spawn a long-running background job, or has a fundamentally non-pure engine). So far, all 5 fit.

## ADR-020: English-Only UI, Filipino Cultural References in Copy

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** Audience is Filipino, but the working language for Amazon PPC is English. Translating UI to Tagalog would create two parallel string catalogs and slow every copy change.
**Decision:** English UI. Filipino cultural references in copy (real ₱ amounts, real cities, real VA scenarios). No formal i18n framework. Strings live in `src/lib/copy/` keyed by `copyId`, so a future i18n is mechanical, not architectural.
**Consequences:**
- One copy catalog. One translator, one voice review.
- Filipino context lives in the content (lessons, scenarios, examples), not the chrome.
- v2.1 can add Tagalog without an architectural change — strings move to `src/lib/copy/tl/`.
- **Revisit when:** Demand for Tagalog / Cebuano UI is real and measurable.

## ADR-021: Append-Only Progress Log

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-17)
**Context:** Lesson completion, quiz attempts, simulator runs, and streak visits all need to be recorded. Storing only the latest state ("lesson X is complete") loses history; rebuilding state from the log later is the only honest way to support analytics, refunds, and certificate re-issuance.
**Decision:** Every progress event is a `ProgressEvent` row (append-only). Denormalized counters on `Enrollment` (`lastLessonId`, `percentComplete`) are derived, rebuilt from the log by a daily job. The log is the source of truth.
**Consequences:**
- Analytics, fraud detection, and "did this user actually complete the course" questions are all answerable from the log.
- Refund logic can recompute the user's effective access from the log at any point in time.
- Storage is cheap; the log is bounded by user activity, not page views.
- **Revisit when:** Log size becomes a real cost concern (currently not — Vercel Postgres scales fine at projected volume).

## ADR-022: Lighthouse CI — Diagnose, Document, and Re-enable

**Status:** Accepted (workaround) — 2026-07-20
**Status:** Implemented (fix landed) — 2026-07-20
**See:** [`docs/adr/0026-lighthouse-ci-disabled.md`](adr/0026-lighthouse-ci-disabled.md) for the full diagnosis.

**Context:** Lighthouse CI was failing in CI due to a Next.js 16 + Turbopack bundler artifact issue (broken symlinks in `.next/node_modules/@*/client-<hash>` pointing to pnpm-store paths outside the artifact). Eight fix attempts did not make progress.

**Decision (initial, 2026-07-20):** Disable the Lighthouse CI job. Re-enable it once `next.config.ts` is updated to use `output: 'standalone'`, which produces a self-contained artifact that doesn't rely on pnpm-store symlinks.

**Decision (implemented, 2026-07-20 evening):** Added `output: 'standalone'` to `next.config.ts`. Updated the build job to upload `.next/standalone + .next/static + public`. Updated the lighthouse job to download the artifact, start `node .next/standalone/server.js`, wait for `/api/health`, and run `lhci autorun`. The job is currently a soft-pass (logs results, doesn't fail the build) until we have a stable baseline; tighten to hard-fail once the numbers stabilize.

**Consequences (initial):**
- Lighthouse checks didn't run on every PR. Performance and a11y regressions were caught by manual runs against the Vercel deployment.
- The handoff was unblocked. PR #101 (E2E fix) merged cleanly.

**Consequences (after fix):**
- Lighthouse checks now run on every PR. Perf / a11y / SEO / best-practices regressions are caught automatically.
- The CI artifact (`.next/standalone/`) is the same shape Vercel uses in production, so what we measure locally is what users see.
- The job is soft-pass for now — false positives on a hard-fail job would be worse than no check. Once a baseline exists, the thresholds can be tightened.

**PR:** #116 (`fix(ci): re-enable Lighthouse CI via output: 'standalone' (STORY-0026 fix)`).
